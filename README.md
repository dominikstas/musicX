# MusicX

MusicX is a Django web application designed to help music enthusiasts (mainly me) organize and manage their music collection. At the moment, the application allows users to view a list of music albums, filter albums by media type (CD or Vinyl), and add new albums to their collection.

## Features

- View a list of music albums with details such as title, artist, media type, and year of purchase.
- Filter albums by media type (CD or Vinyl) to easily find what you're looking for.
- Add new albums to your collection by providing title, artist, media type, year of purchase, and cover image (as link).
